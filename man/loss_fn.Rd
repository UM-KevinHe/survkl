\title{Calculate the Log-Partial Likelihood for a Stratified Cox Model}
\usage{
loss_fn(z, delta, time, stratum, beta)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{A numeric matrix (or data frame coercible to matrix) of covariates.
Each row is an observation and each column a predictor.}

\item{delta}{A numeric vector of event indicators (1 = event, 0 = censored).}

\item{time}{A numeric vector of observed times (event or censoring).}

\item{stratum}{An optional vector specifying the stratum for each observation
(factor/character/numeric). If missing, a single-stratum model is assumed.}

\item{beta}{A numeric vector of regression coefficients with length equal to
the number of columns in \code{z}.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value giving the stratified Cox partial log-likelihood.
}
\description{
Computes the stratified Cox partial log-likelihood for given covariates,
event indicators, times, and coefficients.
}
\details{
Inputs are internally sorted by \code{stratum} and \code{time}. The function
evaluates the stratified Cox partial log-likelihood using the supplied \code{z},
\code{delta}, \code{beta}, and the stratum sizes.
